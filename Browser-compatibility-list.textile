This is still a draft. Feel free to improve it. Don't rely on it.

This is a list of browsers and OS on which Blueprint CSS has been tested:

|_. OS |_. browser |_. browser version |_. blueprint version |_. results  |_. notes |
| Windows | Internet Explorer | 8  | 0.8 | n/a |  |
| Windows | Internet Explorer | 7.0.5730.13  | 0.8 | ok | XP pro SP3|
| Windows | Internet Explorer | 6.0.379.0 | 0.8 | ok | server 2003 |
| Windows | Internet Explorer | 5.5 | 0.8 | n/a |  |
| Windows | Google Chrome | 0.4.154.29 | 0.8 | ok | XP pro SP3 |
| OSX | Safari | 3.2.1 (4525.27.1) | 0.8 | ok | os x 10.4 |
| OSX | Firefox | 2.0.0.18 | 0.8 | ok | os x 10.4 |
| OSX | Camino | 2007112812 (1.5.4) | 0.8 | ok | os x 10.4 |

The test method is:
* open the "blueprint test page":http://blueprintcss.org/tests/ in the target browser;
* open each of the child test pages;
* check that each page displays correctly.

Todo list:
# offer way to report bug/incompatibility and contribute
# more OSes and browsers;
# decide if we should include OS version;
# use screenshots? where should it be hosted?
